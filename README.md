This program suite is intended to provide a relatively simple platform to allow young programmers to write interesting code. 

In pyBots, you write a Python program to control a virtual robot. Up to four robots compete in a battle to the death. All robots are identical with the exception of the control programs and option settings. 

The pyBots package provides a simple programming interface to your robot, as well as some sample robots that you can use as programming examples and as competitors.

Each robot can move around, search for other robots, and try to destroy them.

There are automation features that you can use to get up and running very quickly with almost no code, or you can carefully program every detail of your robotâ€™s behavior.
