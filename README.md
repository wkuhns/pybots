This program suite is intended to provide a relatively simple platform to allow young programmers to write interesting code. 
The challenge is to write Python code using a simple API to control an autonomous robot who will battle other robots in an arena. Sample code is provided, and there are selectable automated capabilities that can provide a working robot with virtually no new code.
